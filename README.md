# WhatsApp-Message-Automation-In-Python
This Python project automates sending scheduled WhatsApp messages using the Twilio API. It prompts the user for the recipientâ€™s number, message, and desired date and time. The script checks if the entered time is in the future, calculates the delay, waits, and then sends the message automatically.
